# Local News Data Project

#### i.e. a list of all the local news sites in the United States

how easy is it to gather all the local news sites in the U.S.? Extremely hard I bet but I'm going to sketch some thoughts out while this [tweet complaint](https://twitter.com/skonradb/status/1257701147068043264) about the incompleteness of [NYT's World Press Freedom local news database](https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1256987337726271488) is fresh in my mind. 



## Criteria for inclusion

- Must specialize in original content for a specified geographic entity, e.g. *not* the New York Times, Bloomberg, ESPN, etc.
- More original content than syndicated
- Publish at least biweekly
- Bylined original content
- At least 1 editor and 1 reporter living in/near the geographic coverage area
- Not a [web of content farms](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/us/michigan-metric-media-news.html)
